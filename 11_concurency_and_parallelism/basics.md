# Concurrency and Parallelism in Python

## Concurrency

**Concurrency is performing multiple task at once! Well, Concurrency ~ Context-Switching**
**Computers are much more faster in context switching, that we feel like multiple tasks are performed simultaneously, but in reality one task is processed at a time**

_Most of the time you dont need Parallel processing, you just need concurrency, because CPUs are expert in switching the tasks, they can use nano-seconds and mili-seconds to perform the computations_

_Single Processor executing multiple tasks using context switching ~ Concurrency_

## Parallelism

**Running Multiple tasks, at the exact same time, and Python uses multiple cores to do this tasks**
